#### Intro to R

This is an R Markdown document that I have output to an HTML presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for producing HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Each homework will be completed in this format and you will submit both the markdown document with code (.Rmd) and the compiled document (.html). With this format all necessary code (including python code!) may be included in one source and the graders may easily reproduce your results.

Homework files will be provided in several sources depending on thir type/size. Canvas will contain the problem sets and you will submit your completed homework here. GitHub will also contain the problem sets as well as necessary (small) datasets, etc. The Odyssey cluster will contain larger datafiles (/n/stat115/) and will be necessary for high performance computing later in the semester.

But first, let's get R/RStudio downloaded!

---

#### Download R/RStudio

![https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](figures/rstudio.png)

---

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio2.png")
```

---

Before we get into knitting, let's consider the concept of a working directory.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# where am I
getwd()

# change where I am (use the RStudio Session > Set Working Directory >
# To Source File Location)
setwd("~/Downloads/")

# list all files
dir()
```

---

We often want to install packages to add some extra functionality on top of base R (https://cran.r-project.org/). To do so, we need to know the name of the package (often found via a google search) and we need to install it. Once installed, we need to load the package into the namespace. 

Let's try to install the `nycflights13` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
```

Load the packages using the `library` command.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Now make sure to open the markdown document and follow along! Download either from canvas or from (https://github.com/stat115/Lab1).

---

#### Quick GitHub Detour

GitHub is a version control system that we will be using primarily as a repository for the homeworks and labs. It is a great tool and we recommend learning and utilizing GitHub for your own work. Lots of tutorials are available such as (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). 

You will only be required to download the homework files and labs but there are many more features worth learning (commiting, branching, etc.). But first, let's download the lab files.

---

#### Quick GitHub Detour

- First, register for an account (https://github.com/join)
    - Students get some great extras free for two years as well (https://education.github.com).

- Navigate to the stat115 github page (https://github.com/stat115/)

- Click on the Lab 1 repository

- Click the "Clone or download" button.
    - Either Download Zip and open in finder/explorer. Open in RStudio.
    - Alternatively, copy the URL to the clipboard (https://github.com/stat115/Lab1.git). Switch to RStudio. Click the "Project (None)" button in the near the top menu bar. Click "New Project", "Version Control", "Git", then paste the URL into the first box.
    - Third option, download from Canvas and open/save as a new R markdown file (.Rmd).

- Now this will open up a stylized coding window. Please scroll to $\approx$ line 120

---

#### R Markdown

To submit your homework you will need to knit the homework .Rmd file and submit both the html and the code. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# we can adjust the size of the text
# Big
## Kinda big
### Still biggish
#### Pretty Normal
```

You can also **bold** or *italicize* text easily. LaTex code may be added inline, such as $\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$, as well as inline `code`. Images are very easy to display as well (see above). To suppress code, name chunks, etc. we need to specify the option to the R code chunk. Note that `echo=FALSE` may be added and the code chunk will not be shown at all.

```{r section_name, eval=FALSE}
# sample code block
```

---

#### R Markdown

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
flights %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = origin, y = arr_delay)) + geom_boxplot() +
    ggtitle("Arrival Delays for Flights in NYC Area")
```

---

#### R Markdown

A great cheatsheet is available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

---

#### Intro to  R

Now we will go over basic R commands and data structures.

---

#### R Vectors

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # R is a vectorized language
print(x[1])

# Operations are performed to each element
x^2
sqrt(x)

y <- x<3 # Vectors may be logical as well
print(y)
```

---

#### R Matrices

```{r}
y <- matrix(1:8,nrow=2,ncol=4,byrow=FALSE) # Create a 2x4 matrix
y[1,2] # Access first row second column
y[,2] # Access the second column
dim(y) # Size of y
y %*% t(y) # Matrix multiplication
```

---

#### R Data Frames

```{r}
policy.number <- c("A00187", "A00300","A00467","A01226")
issue.age <- c(74,30,68,74)
sex <- c("F", "M", "M", "F")
smoke <- c("S","N","N","N")
face.amount <- c(420, 1560, 960, 1190)
ins.df <- data.frame(policy.number, issue.age, sex, smoke, face.amount) # Create it

ins.df[1,] # access first row
ins.df[,1] # access first column
ins.df$policy.number # access policy number column
colnames(ins.df) # column names
dim(ins.df)
```

--- 

#### Getting Help

- `?` command, e.g. `?median`
- Google

---

#### Bioconductor

We already discussed how to install and load libraries coming from CRAN. However, often we will want to install packages from other sources. In computational biology, many of these will come from [Bioconductor](www.bioconductor.org).

The process is much the same, but now we need to tell R to look in there instead of a CRAN mirror.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("affy", version = "3.8")
```

Once it's been downloaded we can simply load it via the library call.

```{r}
library(affy)
```

---

#### Intro to dplyr package

- `dplyr` is an R package that makes it really easy and intuitive to
manipulate data.
- Data science (and computational biology) is 80% data cleaning, 20%
analysis.
- Material taken from dplyr vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html

---

#### filter

- Select specific rows based on conditions.

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

---

#### select

- Select specific columns

```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

---

#### mutate

- Add new columns

```{r}
mutate(flights,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

---

#### arrange

- Sort dataframe by columns.

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

---

#### desc

- Use `desc` to sort by descending order.

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```
---

#### summarize

- Take many numbers and condense them into 1 number.

```{r}
summarise(flights,
  delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

---

#### group_by

- The true power of dplyr comes into play when we can perform grouped
operations.
- First, group by plane. Then, summarize the number of flights, average
distance, and average delay.

```{r}
by_tailnum <- group_by(flights, tailnum)
delay <- summarise(by_tailnum,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dist < 2000)
delay
```


---

#### The pipe, part 1

When you manipulate data with dplyr, you always have to save the
result to a new variable. 

```{r}
a1 <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
a2 <- select(a1, arr_delay, dep_delay)
a3 <- summarise(a2,
  arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
  dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
a4 <- filter(a3, arr > 30 | dep > 30)
```

---

#### The pipe, part 2

If you don't want to rename intermediate results, you have to wrap
the function calls inside each other:

```{r}
filter(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flights, year, month, day),
      arr_delay, dep_delay
    ),
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  arr > 30 | dep > 30
)
```

---

#### The pipe, part 3

But this can be hard to read, since we are going inside-out. Instead,
we can use the `%>%` command, which turns `f(x, y)` into `x %>% f(y)`.
This is much easier to read.

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  summarise(
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(arr > 30 | dep > 30)
```

---

#### group_by example

- What is this code doing?

```{r}
flights %>% filter(origin == "EWR") %>%
    group_by(dest) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(n))
```

---

#### Plotting

- We will use `ggplot` from the `ggplot2` package.

```{r}
flights %>%
    filter(arr_delay <= 360) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = arr_delay, color = origin)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ggtitle("Delay by Month") +
    xlab("Month") +
    ylab("Arrival Delay (min)")
```

---

#### Plotting

```{r}
flights %>%
    filter(month == 1, arr_delay < 360, dep_delay < 360) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) +
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Relation between Dep and Arrival Delay") +
    xlab("Departure Delay (min)") +
    ylab("Arrival Delay (min)")
```
